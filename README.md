# beatlux
Beatlux is a music visualisation software. It features a music player with all the standard functions, as well as some visualisations that react to the music that is playing. You are able to create playlists, customize the visualisations and move through the visualisations freely.

## Code Example
    void Start()
    {
        // Initializing the scene, creating a circle of cubes in the radius set above.
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfObjects; i++)
        {
            float angle = i * Mathf.PI * 2 / numberOfObjects;
            Vector3 pos = new Vector3 (Mathf.Cos (angle), 0, Mathf.Sin (angle)) * radius;
            Instantiate (prefab, pos, Quaternion.identity, Settings.MenuManager.vizContents);
        }
        cubes = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag ("Cubes");
    }
    void Update()
    {
        // Reading the spectrum from the song put into the AudioListener 
        float[] spectrum = Settings.MenuManager.audio.GetSpectrumData (1024, 0, FFTWindow.Hamming);
    }
New visualisations can be added to the programm as a new scene in Unity. They also have to be added to the class "Settings".

## Motivation
The creation of Beatlux was the result of a student project of the study course "Media-Informatics" at Harz University of Applied Science Wernigerode. The task was to visualize music in any form, so we decided to create a program that does just that.

## Installation
To install the program, simply download the appropriate files for your operating system from our website (http://beatlux.hs-harz.de) and run it on your computer.

## API Reference
https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/

## Tests
Just build the project in Unity for your operating system, run it and try it out.

## Contributors
Anyone who wants to participate in the development of Beatlux can simply fork the project and change anything, since it's open source.
